# Spam Classifier Project

## Project Need

Spam emails continue to plague email systems worldwide, leading to wasted time, reduced productivity, and exposure to security risks such as phishing and malware attacks. While existing solutions offer some relief, they often misclassify important emails or fail to filter out new spam patterns.

This project addresses the need for an advanced and accurate spam classification system, leveraging machine learning and natural language processing techniques. By building a robust spam classifier, the goal is to enhance email filtering mechanisms, minimize user intervention, and reduce the threat posed by spam emails in an increasingly digital world.

## Why This Matters

- **Efficiency**: Saves users from sifting through spam manually.
- **Security**: Protects sensitive data by reducing phishing threats.
- **Innovation**: Explores cutting-edge AI methodologies to tackle evolving spam tactics.

## Goals

1. Accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).
2. Develop a scalable and adaptive model capable of handling new spam patterns.
3. Improve user experience by minimizing false positives and false negatives.
